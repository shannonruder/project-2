git notes

master branch

nobody touches

push to your own local branch

merge to master

contributors initials and what they are working on 

navbar-sr or
frontend-jv or
backend-dr



these are mergeable branches --when finished you can create a new branch or clone merged updated master repo and use that same branch or create a new one.

after you clone the master repo, the first thing you do everytime is git status

git status tells you if you are up to date and on which branch your are working

git checkout -b <name>

names a new branch and switches you to it.

Use git status to see where you are

always do add . then

always git commit -m

you don't have to push while switching the branches



to push the code on a certain branch you use git push "origin" and the branch name

you will never push class to master

when you do a merge conflict resolution - it will copy the code to the master

DON'T PUSH CODE TO THE MASTER

just create a new branch

create 1 repo - 1 branch - write something in a file and push the code....and merge the code to master

do git checkout master and pull code from master then create a second branch and in this branch try to overwrite something that initially u pulled form the master and then push it -- and merge it online and it's going to show a conflict and you solve the conflict.

i created branches for each of us. Please change to your branch when making changes. contact me so we can resolve merge conflicts together.
