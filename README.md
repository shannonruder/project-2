# Food n Flix

An app created to help alleviate the need for indecision surrounding what movie to pick and what food to order in for a special evening with friends or family at home. FoodnFlix is an event planner app that provides users with a shortcut to pairing a movie with a nearby restaurant. We do this by getting to know our users and their preferences.</p>
